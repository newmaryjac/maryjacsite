I’m a New York-based content designer at JP Morgan Chase. Previously, I’ve worked for Datadog, EDR, and Wallplay.

I have a B.A. in Digital Media Studies from Scripps College with a minor in Computer Science.

Here are just a few of the things I’m curious about:
•   Design technology
•   Cybernetics
•   Art history
•   Really, really good chairs
